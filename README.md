# to-do-application

## About The Project

This is my first attempt at learning React Native, Javascript, and any other related topics.
I decided the best way to learn is through experience

Here's why I'm creating a to-do application:
* I am a goal/task oriented person who appreciates simplicity and ease of access
* While I'm sure there are many great applications that provide the functionality I seek, I wanted to start a simple project as a hobby and a cool way to learn new things
* I eventually would like to escalate this application to a web-app form where users (me) could view the same data on mobile and desktop

Of course, this project is only for fun and learning purposes.
